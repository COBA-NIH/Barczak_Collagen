## Project Outline

The aim of the project is to study the changes in the collagen content in murine lungs upon infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and how the collagen content changes at multiple timepoints upon treatment. The dataset for this project comprises brighfield images of Masson's trichrome stained murine lung tissue from (i) healthy/uninfected mice, (ii) M.tuberculosis-infected untreated/vehicle-treated mice, sacrificed at 3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 20 weeks, and (iii) M.tuberculosis-infected drug treated mice, sacrificed at 3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, or 20 weeks.
