# Automated quantitation of collagen content in murine lung tissue

This repository contains a descriptive outline of the work done for this Driving Biological Project, and the scripts, pipelines, and codes used to analyze the images and data.

## Project Outline
The aim of the project is to study the changes in the collagen content in murine lungs upon infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and how the collagen content changes at multiple timepoints upon treatment. The dataset for this project comprises brighfield images of Masson's trichrome stained murine lung tissue from (i) healthy/uninfected mice, (ii) M.tuberculosis-infected untreated/vehicle-treated mice, sacrificed at 3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 20 weeks, and (iii) M.tuberculosis-infected drug treated mice, sacrificed at 3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14, 16, or 20 weeks.
